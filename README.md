# Database2Code

You can download the extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ignatandrei.databasetocode

Modify the connectionDetails.txt and it will generate from you everything to WebAPI from SqlServer or Sqlite ( more providers soon). 
 
Also, it generates  different projects ( models, context, controllers) â€“ and you can also modify the templates. It works ( for the moment) just with tables with 0 or 1 PK.
